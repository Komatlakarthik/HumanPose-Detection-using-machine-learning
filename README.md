# Human Pose Detection using Machine learning

This project detects **human poses** in **images** using **Machine learning** that makes use of **Blaze Pose** detection method and is deployed with **Streamlit**.

## 📌 Features  
✅ Detects **33 body landmarks** using **BlazePose**  
✅ Works on **images**  
✅ **Streamlit UI** for easy interaction  
✅ Real-time **pose tracking** with OpenCV  
✅ Simple deployment & lightweight inference
